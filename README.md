# Interactive poll of polls using plotly
This is an interactive line graph that displays the seats won by different Spanish parties across elections. It was a casual attempt to recreate the plot here: https://pollofpolls.eu/ES.

The dataset for this can be found online here: https://pollofpolls.eu/get/polls/ES-parliament/format/csv.

You can view the final output on my Rpubs page here: http://rpubs.com/hemanthb/spain_interactive.
